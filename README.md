This project demonstrates the classification of Iris flower species using Machine Learning. 
The dataset contains 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.
Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
Used algorithm Support Vector Machines (SVM), the model predicts the species based on the input features. 
This project highlights fundamental machine learning techniques like data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
